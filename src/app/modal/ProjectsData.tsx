    "This project is a custom-designed e-commerce platform tailored for a client in the herbal medicine and mushroom tincture niche. On the backend, the site leverages Strapi, offering the client an intuitive interface to seamlessly manage product inventoryâ€”enabling add, edit, and delete functionalities.\n\n The frontend employs ReactJS for a responsive user experience, with Redux overseeing the state management of the shopping cart. For payment processing, the platform integrates Stripe's secure checkout system. A specialized webhook is also incorporated to sync with the inventory management system, thereby eliminating the possibility of customers ordering out-of-stock items.\n\n In terms of aesthetics, the styling is executed through JavaScript using Material-UI (MUI) React components, negating the need for external stylesheets.",
